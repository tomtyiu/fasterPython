# Optimized vs lists
set_data = set(list_data)
another_set = set(another_list)
result = set_data - another_set

#Operation: Converts both lists to sets and computes a set difference.
#Time complexity:
#Creating a set from a list is O(n).
#Set difference (set_data - another_set) is roughly O(len(set_data)), because sets use hash tables for membership checks.
#Overall: O(m + n) — linear.
#Why faster:
#Sets have O(1) average-time membership checks due to hashing.
#No repeated scanning of the entire collection for each item.
